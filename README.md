# Abdullah Hamdan â€“ LaravelShop

This is a laravel project that I did to basically learn laravel. It has full authentication using breeze and uses email vertification also when creating and loging accounts. Every one has a profile and they can select the their image and enter their bio. They can also later update if they want later when they are logged in. Every one can post items for other people to buy. The people that want to later buy it will do it via paypal integration. The money goes to the website owner and then the users that sold that item will be able to collect the paypal money. Also when a guy buyes from the buyer the buyer sees where he want their delievery to be delievered at. I wanted to implement PostNord api for the delievery time and to select delievery points but they took too long to answer and give me a SECRET KEY. The user that buys the produkt gets notified also when buying in the web application so that when a user wants to scam them they have proof that they bought the item. The users are able to modify their posts.
